## Overview

This project implements the classic "Guess The Number" game in a visually modern, mobile-inspired web interface. The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100, and you have 10 attempts to guess it. After each guess, you'll get hints: "LESS THAN THAT" or "GREATER THAN THAT". Play again as many times as you like!
